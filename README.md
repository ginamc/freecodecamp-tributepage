# TRIBUTE PAGE - FreeCode Camp: Responsive Web Design Project 1

This project was completed as part of FreeCode Camp's section on Responsive Web Design elements. I was given a completed layout via Codepen.io and had to recreate the page using the tools covered in the curriculum (HTML, CSS). The objective of the project was to test my skills in responsive web design by targeting the image to behave responsively in relation to screen size.

Once I completed the project objectives, I uploaded it to Codepen.io, and ran the FreeCode Camp test script. All objectives were met after minor edits.
